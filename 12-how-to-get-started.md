### 1.2 How to get started?

Post Gallery is a web application that allows you to aggregate you social networks content. Post Gallery provides a service that allows users to turn a Facebook Timeline \(as such is defined by Facebook\) and other social network content \(e.g. Instagram\) into an interactive gallery. We collect also all your friends interactions:  likes and comments made on your Timeline to get easy access to all of your memories in one place.
