### 1.1 What is Post Gallery web app?

Post Gallery is a web application that allows you to aggregate you social networks content. Post Gallery provides a service that allows users to turn a Facebook Timeline \(as such is defined by Facebook\) and other social network content \(e.g. Instagram\) into an interactive gallery. We collect also all your friends interactions:  likes and comments made on your Timeline to get easy access to all of your memories in one place.

Memories are precious and the important moments in your life need to be celebrated and treasured. When it comes to reliving those life-changing events, there is no easier way to do it than by using Post Gallery.

Whether you want to create an album to record the birth of your child, remember a special vacation or celebrate a friendship or relationship, Post Gallery makes it easy and simple for you.

You can use Post Gallery as your very own personalized yearbook, a friendship book you can share with your friends, a wedding book that documents the special day you tied the knot with your soul mate, or a baby book that shows the sweet and cute memories of your little one.

And it doesn’t end there. You can also use Post Gallery as a scrapbook, a family book, a fan page book, a memory book or simply a photo book.
