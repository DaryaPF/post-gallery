What is Acronis Cloud mobile app?

Acronis Cloud is a mobile application that allows you to browse, open and download data you backed

up using Acronis Backup & Recovery and stored on Acronis Cloud. Use your mobile phone or a tablet

to get easy access to all of the backups created on all of your computers anytime and anywhere. This

app also enables you to view and download previous versions of your backed up files. Your data will

always be within easy reach.

Which devices does the mobile app support?

You can install Acronis Cloud on any mobile devices that have iOS \(iPhone, iPad, iPod\) and Android

\(mobile phones and tablets\) operating systems.

How it works

Acronis Cloud mobile app connects to Acronis Cloud via the Internet and allows you to access data

backed up using Acronis Backup & Recovery. Note that Acronis Cloud mobile app is useless without

Acronis Cloud, so you need to subscribe to the service first.



Browse and open files stored in file backups on Acronis Cloud.

Note, that you cannot browse disk and partition backups, you can only view them in the backup list.

 Add files to Favorites \(in Android\) or Pinned \(in iOS\) to keep them up-to-date and get offline

access.

 View the list of previous versions of backed up files and open a chosen version on your mobile

device.

How we ensure the security of your data

You may want to be sure that your personal files won't get into the wrong hands. You may be

especially concerned about your mobile device, because all of your data will be transferred through

the Internet.

Let us assure you that your data will be safe. First of all, we use encrypted protocol SSL to transfer all

data through the Internet. To access the backup data, sign in to your account by providing the e-mail

address and password for that account.

Furthermore, we store your data on our servers in encrypted form. Only you have access to your

encrypted data.

2.1

Signing in to your account

To use the app, you need to sign in using the email address and password of your Acronis account.

If you do not have an Acronis account yet, click Create new account \(Get a free account, if you use

iOS\) and follow instructions at our website.

By default you need to sign in only when you start the application for the first time.

If you are worried that somebody might get access to your files if your iPhone is lost or stolen, you

can disable the automatic signing in on your iPhone \(see details in The Settings tab \(p. 8\)\). In this

case, you will have to sign in each time you start the application.

2.2

App overview

The Acronis Cloud interface consists of three tabs: Cloud, Favorites \(Pinned - in iOS\) and Settings.

Cloud

This tab contains the online backup files created by using Acronis Backup&Recovery and stored on

Acronis Cloud. You can view the backed up files, add them to Favorites \(in Android\) or Pinned \(in

iOS\), and open previous versions of the files. If a backup is protected with an encryption key, the app

will ask for the key when you try to open the backup.

6

Copyright © Acronis International GmbH, 2002-2012At the bottom of the screen there is a special area which shows you the used space of your Acronis

Cloud and the expiration date of your subscription.

Favorites \(Pinned - in iOS\)

This tab contains a list of files downloaded from Acronis Cloud and available to you offline. You can

add files to Favorites \(Pinned - in iOS\) from your file backups. When added, the latest version of the

files will always be available on the tab.

Settings

This tab contains the app settings. See details in The Settings tab \(p. 8\).

Copyright © Acronis International GmbH, 2002-20122.2.1

The Settings tab

The Settings tab consists of four sections: Application, Local Storage, Account and About.

The Application section

 Use Wi-Fi only

If the setting is turned on, data download is performed only via Wi-Fi. This is useful because

sometimes Wi-Fi connection is cheaper \(or even free\) or more reliable than other connection

types.

 Sign in automatically

If you turn on the setting, you will not need to enter your e-mail and password every time you

start the app.

 Sign out

This command ends your current session of the app work.

The Local storage section

 Favorites size \(or Pinned files size - in iOS\)

This field shows you the total size of files stored in your Favorites \(or Pinned - in iOS\).

 Local cache size

This item allows you to specify the size of the local cache. The local cache is a memory space

used to speed up such operations as opening files on Acronis Cloud, downloading files, etc. Note

that to download a big file, you must first make sure that the local cache size is bigger than the

file size; otherwise, downloading will be impossible.

 Clear local cache

This command deletes all data from the local cache.

The Account section



8

Email

This field shows the email address you specified when you registered your account.

Copyright © Acronis International GmbH, 2002-2012The About section

 App version

This field shows the version of the app you use.

 Tell friends about Acronis Cloud

This command allows you to recommend Acronis Cloud to others by sending them a special

message to the specified email addresses.
